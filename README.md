There are 2 types of file. They both are same but I have changed extension of project.
With development of technology, social media take huge up space for every one us. There are same activities that
people can do on social media like sharing photos and videos,chatting a new friend, following our network and more and more.
After all these stuff, people can take their photo and imply filter on it. These filters can be beauty,entertainment, animation or
quizzes. There are many popular filters on social media. Because of the covid-19 virus, people stayed at their home and shared
themselves through their face with using filters. At the same time, people who are filter creators, spent much more time to being
creative for these filters. After all these information, this work uses human faces and filters on this project. There is a problem
that using human face without permission is not legal. Therefore, it is used that LFW which is publicly shared clean and popular
data set. In this project, OpenFilter framework and ManyCam is used for applying filter on face of humans. It is examined that
the a couple of results for between original and filtered images.
